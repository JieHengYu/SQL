    "No, use `numeric(8, 3)` instead. The first argument in the `numeric()` function is the precision & the second argument is the scale. Precision is the total number of digits in the decimal number. Scale is the number of digits to the right of the decimal point. If we look at the numbers in our file, they all have 3 digits after the decimal point, so our scale is 3. They all also consist of 8 digits, so the precision is 8. This gives us our data type `numeric(8, 3)`. "
