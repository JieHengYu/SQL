    "# Understanding Math Operators & Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The table belwo shows nine math operators you'll use most often in your calculations. The first four (addition, subtraction, multiplication, & division) are part of the ANSI SQL standard & are implemented in all database systems. The others are PostgreSQL-specific operators, although most other database maangers likely have functions or operators to perform those operations too. For example, the modulo operator (`%`) works in Microsoft SQL Server & MySQL, as well as with PostgreSQL. If you're using another database system, check its documentation.\n",

    "\n",
    "## Adding, Subtracting, & Multiplying\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with simple integer addition, subtraction, & multiplication. Here are three examples, each with the `SELECT` keyword followed by the math formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT 2 + 2;\n",
    "SELECT 9 - 1;\n",
    "SELECT 3 * 4;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "None of these statements is rocket science, so you shouldn't be surprised that `SELECT 2 + 2;` in the Query Tool shows a result of `4`. Similarly, the examples for subtraction & multiplication yield what you'd expect: `8` & `12`. The output displays in a column, as with any query result. But because we're not querying a table or specifying a column, the results appear beneath a `?column?` name, signifying an unknown column:\n",

    "<img src = \"Subtraction.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "<img src = \"Multiplication.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "That's okay. We're not affecting any data in a table, just displaying a result. If you want to display a column name, you can provide an alias, as in `SELECT 3 * 4 AS result;`.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Performing Division & Modulo\n",
    "\n",
    "Division with SQL gets alittle trickier because of the difference between math with integers & math with decimals. Add in *modulo*, an operator that returns just the *remainder* of the division operation, & the results can be confusing.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT 11 / 6;\n",
    "SELECT 11 % 6;\n",
    "SELECT 11.0 / 6;\n",
    "SELECT CAST (11 AS numeric(3, 1)) / 6;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `/` operator divides the integer `11` by another integer, `6`. If you do that math in your head, you know the answer is `1` with a remainder of `5`. However, running this query yields `1`, which is how SQL handles division of one integer by another -- by reporting only the integer `quotient` without any remainder.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Integer Division in SQL 1.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want the retrieve the *remainder* as an integer, you must perform the same calculation using the modulo operator `%`. That statement returns just the remainder, in this case `5`. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Integer Division in SQL 2.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "No single operation today will provide you with both the quotient & remainder as integers. \n",
    "\n",
    "Modulo is useful for more than just fetching the remainder: you can use it as a test condition. For example, to check whether a number is even, you can test it using the `% 2` operation. If the result is `0` with no remainder, the number is even.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways to divide two numbers & have the result return as a `numeric` type. First, if one or both of the numbers is a `numeric`, the result will by default be expressed as `numeric`. That happens when we divide `11.0` by `6`. The result is `1.83333`. The number of decimal digits displayed may vary according to your PostgreSQL & system settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Decimal Division in SQL 1.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, if you're working with data stored only as integer & need to force decimal division, you can use `CAST` to convert one of the integers to a `numeric` type. Executing this also returns `1.83333`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Decimal Division in SQL 2.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Using Exponents, Roots, & Factorials\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond the basics, PostgreSQL also provides operators & functions to square, cube or otherwise raise a base number to an exponent as well as find roots or the factorial of a number.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT 3 ^ 4;\n",
    "SELECT |/ 10;\n",
    "SELECT sqrt(10);\n",
    "SELECT ||/ 10;\n",
    "SELECT factorial(4);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The exponentiation operator (`^`) allows you to raise a given base number to an exponent, where `3 ^ 4` returns `81`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Exponents in SQL.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can find the square root of a number in two ways: using the `|/` operator or the `sqrt(n)` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Square Root in SQL 1.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "<img src = \"Square Root in SQL 2.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "For a cube root, use the `||/` operator. Both are *prefix operators*, because they come before a single value.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Cube Root in SQL.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To find the *factorial* of a number, you can use the `factorial(n)` function. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Factorial in SQL.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Again, these operators are specific to PostgreSQL; they're not part of the SQL standard. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Minding the Order of Operations\n",
    "\n",
    "You may recall what th order of operations is on a mathematical expression. SQL follows the established math standard. For PostgreSQL operators discussed so far, the order is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Exponents & roots\n",
    "* Multiplication, division, modulo\n",
    "* Addition & subtraction\n",
    "\n",
    "Given these rules, you'll need to encase an operation in parentheses if you want to calculate it in a different order. For example the following two expressions yield different results:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT 7 + 8 * 9;\n",
    "SELECT (7 + 8) * 9;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The first expression returns `79` because the multiplication operation takes precedent & is processed before the addition. The second returns `135` because the parentheses force the addition operation to occur first.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"PEMDAS 1.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "<img src = \"PEMDAS 2.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep operator precedence in mind to avoid having to correct your analysis later."

    "PostgreSQL (as with most relational databases) does not have a built-in `median()` function. It's also not included in the ANSI SQL standard. Instead, we have to use a SQL *percentile* function to find the median & use *quantiles* or *cut points* to divide a group of numbers into equal sizes. Percentile functions are part of standard ANSI SQL.\n",

    "The `percentile_cont(n)` function calculates percentiles as *continuous* values. That is, the result does not have to be one of the values in the dataset, but can be a decimal value in between two numbers.

    "The median & average are far apart, which shows that averages chan mislead. As of 2019 estimates, half the counties in America had fewer than 25,726 people, whereas half had more. If you gave a presentation on US demographics & told the audience that the \"average county in America has 104,468 people\", they'd walk away with a skewed picture of reality. More than 40 counties were estimated to have a million or more people in 2019, & Los Angeles County had more than 10 million. That pushed the average higher.\n",

    "## Finding Other Quantiles with Percentile Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also slice data into smaller equal groups for analysis. Most common are *quartiles* (four equal groups), *quintiles* (five groups), & *deciles* (10 groups). To find any individual value, you can just plug it into a percentile function. To find the value marking the first quartile or the lowest 25 percent of data, you'd use a value of `0.25`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, entering values one at a time is labourious if you want to generate multiple cut coints. Instead, you can pass values into `percentile_cont()` using an *array*, a list of items.\n",
    "\n",
    "The below code shows how to calculate all four quartiles at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT percentile_cont(ARRAY[0.25, 0.5, 0.75])\n",
    "           WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY pop_est_2019)\n",
    "           AS quartiles\n",
    "FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we create our cut points by enclosing values in an *array constructor* called `ARRAY[]`. An array constructor is an expression that builds an array from the elements included between the square brackets. Inside the brackets, we provide comma-separated values representing the three points at which to cut to create four quartiles. Run the query to see the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Passing Array of Values to percentile_cont().png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we passed an array, PostgreSQL returns an array, denoted in the results by curly brackets. Each quartile is separated by commas. The first quartile is 10,902.5, which means that 25 percent of counties have a population that is equal to or lower than this value. The second quartile is the same as the median: 25,726. The third quartile is 68,072.75, meaning the largest 25 percent of counties have at least this large of a population.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays are defined in the ANSI SQL standard & our use here is just one of several ways you work with arrays in PostgreSQL. You can, for example, define a table column as an array of a particular data type. That's useful if you want store multiple values in a single database column, such as a collection of tags for a blog post, instead of storing them in a separate table. See the [PostgreSQL documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/arrays.html) for examples of declaring, searching, & modifying arrays.\n",
    "\n",
    "Arrays also come with a host of functions that allow you to perform tasks such as adding or removing values, or counting the elements. A handy function for working with the result of our previous query is `unnest()`, which makes the array easier to read by turning it into rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT unnest(\n",
    "    percentile_cont(ARRAY[0.25, 0.5, 0.75])\n",
    "        WITHIN GROUP (ORDER BY pop_est_2019)\n",
    ") AS quartiles\n",
    "FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019;\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now the output should be in rows:\n",

    "If we're computing deciles, pulling them from the resulting array & displaying them in rows would be very helpful."
