    "In this set of exercises, you'll turn the `meat_poultry_egg_establishments` table into useful information. You need to answer two questions: how many of the plants in the table process meat, & how many process poultry?\n",
    "\n",
    "The answers to these two questions lie in the `activities` column. Unfortunately, the column contains an assortment of text with inconsistent input. Here's an example of the kind of text you'll find in the `activities` column:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Poultry Processing, Poultry Slaughter\n",
    "Meat Processing, Poultry Processing\n",
    "Poultry Processing, Poultry Slaughter\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The mishmash of text makes it impossible to perform a typical count that would allow us to group processing plants by activity. However, we can make some modifications to fix this data. Our tasks are as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create two new columns called `meat_processing` & `poultry_processing` in your table. Each can be of the type `boolean`.\n",
    "2. Using `UPDATE`, set `meat_processing = TRUE` on any row in which the `activities` contains the text *Meat Processing*. Do the same update on the `poultry_processing` column, but this time look for the text *Poultry Processing* in `activities`.\n",
    "3. Use the data from the new, updated columns to count how many plants perform each type of activity. For a bonus challenge, count how many plants perform both activities."
