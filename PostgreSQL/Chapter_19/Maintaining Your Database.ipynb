    "# Recovering Unused Space with VACUUM\n",
    "\n",
    "The PostgreSQL `VACUUM` command helps manage the size of a database, which can grow as a result of routine operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when you update a row value, the database creates a new version of that row with the updated value & retains (but hides) the old version of the row. The PostgreSQL documentation refers to these rows that you can't see as *dead tuples*, with *tuples* -- an ordered list of elements -- being the name for the internal implementation of rows in a PostgreSQL database. The same thing happens when you delete a row. Though the row is no longer visible to you, it lives on as a dead row in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is by design, so the database can provide certain features in environments where multiple transactions are occurring, & an old version of a row might be needed by transaction others than the current one.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `VACUUM` command cleans up these dead rows. Running `VACUUM` on its own designates the space occupied by dead rows as available for the database to use again (assuming that any transactions using the rows have been completed). In most cases, `VACUUM` doesn't return the space to your system's disk; it just flags that space as available for new data. To actually shrink the size of the data file, you can run `VACUUM FULL`, which rewrites the table to a new version that doesn't include the dead row space. It drops the old version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although `VACUUM FULL` frees space on your system's disk, there are a couple of caveats to keep in mind. First, `VACUUM FULL` takes more time to complete than `VACUUM`. Second, it must have exclusive access to the table while rewriting it, which means that no one can update data during the operation. The regular `VACUUM` command can run while updates & other operations are happening. Finally, not all dead space in a table is bad. In many cases, having available space to put new tuples instead of needing to ask the operating system for more disk space can improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can run either `VACUUM` or `VACUUM FULL` on demand, but PostgreSQL by default runs an *autovacuum* background process that monitors the database & runs `VACUUM` as needed. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Tracking Table Size\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll create a small test table & monitor its growth as we fill it with data & perform an update. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Creating a Table & Checking Its Size\n",
    "\n",
    "The query below creates a `vacuum_test` table with a single column to hold an integer. Run the code & then we'll measure the table's size.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE vacuum_test (\n",
    "    integer_column integer\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we fill the table with test data, let's check how much space it occupies on disk to establish a reference point. We can do so in two ways: check the table properties via the pgAdmin interface or run queries using PostgreSQL administrative functions. In pgAdmin, click once on a table & then highlight it, & then click the **Statistics** tab. Table size is one of about two dozen indicators in this list.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Creating a Table to Test Vacuuming.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll focus on the running queries technique here because knowing these queries is help if for some reason pgAdmin isn't available or you're using another graphical user interface (GUI). The query below shows how to check the `vacuum_test` table size using PostgreSQL functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT pg_size_pretty(\n",
    "    pg_total_relation_size('vacuum_test')\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The outermost function, `pg_size_pretty()`, converts bytes to a more easily understandable format in kilobytes, megabytes, or gigabytes. Wrapped inside is the `pg_total_relation_size()` function, which reports how many bytes a table, its indexes, & any offline compressed data takes up on disk. Because the table is empty at this point, running the code in pgAdmin should return a value of `0 bytes`, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Determining the Size of vacuum_test.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get the same information using the command line. Launch `psql` & at the prompt, enter the meta-command `\\dt+ vacuum_test`, which should display the following information including table size:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"vacuum_test in the Command Prompt.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Table Size After Adding New Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's add some data to the table & then check its size again. We'll use the `generate_series()` function to fill the table's `integer_column` with 500,000 rows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INSERT INTO vacuum_test\n",
    "SELECT * FROM generate_series(1, 500000);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This standard `INSERT INTO` statement addes the results of `generate_series()`, which is a series of values from 1 to 500,000, as rows to the table. After the query completes, check its size with `pg_size_pretty()` & `pg_total_relation_size()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Inserting 500,000 Rows Into vacuum_test.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The query reports that the `vacuum_test` table, now with a single column of 500,000 integers uses 18,161,664 bytes (18,161,664 / 1024 / 1024 is approximately 17.3 MB) of disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking Table Size After Updates\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, let's update the data to see how that affects the table size. We'll use the code below to update every row in the `vacuum_test` table by adding `1` to the `integer_column` values, replacing the existing value with a number that's one greater.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "UPDATE vacuum_test\n",
    "SET integer_column = integer_column + 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code, then test the table size again.\n",

    "```\n",

    "    pg_total_relation_size('vacuum_test')\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The table size doubled from 17MB to 35MB. The increase seems excessive, because the `UPDATE` simply replaced existing numbers with values of a similar size. As you might have guessed, the reason for this increase in table size is that for every updated value, PostgreSQL creates a new row, & the dead row remains in the table. Even though you see only 500,000 rows, the table has double that number. This behaviour can lead to surprises for database owners who don't monitor disk space.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Checking Table Size After Updates.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Monitoring the Autovacuum Process\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL's autovacuum process monitors the database & launches `VACUUM` automatically when it detects a large number of dead rows in a table. Although autovacuum is enabled by default, you can turn it on or off & configure it using the settings. Because autovacuum runs in the background, you won't see any immediately visible indication that it's working, but you can check its activity by querying data that PostgreSQL collects about system performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL has it own *statistics collector* that tracks database activity & usage. You can look at the statistics by querying one of several views the system provides. (See a complete list of views for monitoring the state of the system in the PostgreSQL documentation under [\"The Statistics Collector\"](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/monitoring-stats.html)) To check the activity of autovacuum, we query the `pg_stat_all_tables` view, as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT relname,\n",
    "       last_vacuum,\n",
    "       last_autovacuum,\n",
    "       vacuum_count,\n",
    "       autovacuum_count\n",
    "FROM pg_stat_all_tables\n",
    "WHERE relname = 'vacuum_test';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A view provides the results of a stored query. The query stored by the view `pg_stat_all_tables` returns a column called `relname`, which is the name of the table, plus columns with statistics related to index scans, rows inserted & deleted, & other data. For this query, we're interested in `last_vacuum` & `last_autovacuum`, which contain the last time the table was vacuumed manually & automatically, respectively. We also ask for `vacuum_count` & `autovacuum_count`, which show the number of times the vacuum was run manually & automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "By default, autovacuum checks tables every minute. So, if a minute has passed since you last updated `vacuum_test`, you should see details of vacuum activity when you run the query above. Here's what my system shows.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Monitoring Autovacuum Process.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The table shows the data & time of the last autovacuum, & the `autovacuum_count` column shows one occurence. This result indicates that autovacuume executed a `VACUUM` command on the table once. However, because we've not vacuumed manually, the `last_vacuum` column is empty, & the `vacuum_count` is `0`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that `VACUUM` designates dead rows as available for the database to reuse but typically doesn't reduce the size of the table on disk. You can confirm this by running our previous query to check the table size, which shows the table remains at 35MB even after the automatic vacuum.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Checking Table Size After Autovacuum.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Running VACUUM Manually\n",
    "\n",
    "To run `VACUUM` manually, we only need a single line of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "VACUUM vacuum_test;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This command should return the message `VACUUM` from the server. Now when you fetch statistics again, using the below query, you should see that the `last_vacuum` column reflects the date & time of the manual vacuum you just ran, & the number in the `vacuum_count` column should increase by one.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT relname,\n",
    "       last_vacuum,\n",
    "       last_autovacuum,\n",

    "       autovacuum_count\n",
    "FROM pg_stat_all_tables\n",
    "WHERE relname = 'vacuum_test';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Running VACUUM Manually.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we executed `VACUUM` on our test table, but you can also run `VACUUM` on the entire database by omitting the table name. In addition, you can add the `VERBOSE` keyword to return information such as the number of rows found in a table & the number of rows removed, among other information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Reducing Table Size with VACUUM FULL\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we'll run `VACUUM` with the `FULL` option, which actually returns the space taken up by dead tuples back to disk. It does this by creating a new version of a table with the dead rows discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see how `VACUUM FULL` works, run the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "VACUUM FULL vacuum_test;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After the command executes, test the table size again. it should be back down to 17MB, the size it was when we first inserted data.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Using VACUUM FULL to Reclaim Disk Space.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "It's never prudent or safe to run out of disk space, so minding the size of your database files as well as your overall system space is a worthwhile routine to establish. Using `VACUUM` to prevent database files from growing bigger than they have to is a good start."
