    "# Using Views to Simplify Queries\n",
    "\n",
    "A *view* is essentially a stored query with a name that you can work with as if it were a table. For example, a view might store a query that calculates total population by state. As with a table, you can query that view, join the view to tables (or to other views), & use the view to update or insert data into a table it's based on, albeit with some caveats. The stored query in a view can be simple, referencing just one table, or complex, with multiple table joins.\n",
    "\n",
    "Views are especially useful in the following scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Avoiding duplicate effort:** They let you write a complex query once & access the results when needed.\n",
    "* **Reducing clutter:** They can trim the amount of information you need to wade through by showing only columns relevant to your needs.\n",
    "* **Providing security:** Views can limit access to only certain columns in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll look at two kinds of views. The first -- a standard view -- contains PostgreSQL syntax that's largely in line with the ANSI SQL standard for views. Every time you access a standard view, the stored query runs & generates a temporary set of results. The second is a *materialised view*, which is specific to PostgreSQL, Oracle, & a limited number of other database systems. When you create a materialised view, the data returned by its query is stored permanently in the database like a table; you can refresh the view to update the stored data if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating & Querying Views\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll return to the census estimates table `us_counties_pop_est_2019`. The query below creates a standard view that returns just the population of Nevada counties. The original table has sixteen columns; the view will return just four of them. This will be  useful for making a subset of Nevada census data quickly accessible when we're referring to it often or using the data in an application.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW nevada_counties_pop_2019\n",
    "AS (\n",
    "    SELECT county_name,\n",
    "           state_fips,\n",
    "           county_fips,\n",
    "           pop_est_2019\n",
    "    FROM us_counties_pop_est-2019\n",
    "    WHERE state_name = 'Nevada'\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We define the view using the keywords `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` followed by the view's name, `nevada_counties_pop_2019`, & then `AS`. Next, we use a standard SQL `SELECT` to fetch the 2019 population estimate (the `pop_est_2019` column) for each Nevada county from the `us_counties_pop_est_2019` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice the `OR REPLACE` keywords after `CREATE`. These are optional & tell the database that if a view with this name already exists, then replace it with the new definition. Its helpful to include these keywords if you're iterating on creating a view & want to refine the query. There is one caveat: if you're replacing an existing view, the new query must generate the same column names with the same data types & in the same order as the one it's replacing. You can add columns, but they must be placed at the end of the column list. If you try to do otherwise, the database will respond with an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the query using pgAdmin. The database should respond with the message `CREATE VIEW`. To find the new view, in pgAdmin's object browser, right-click the `analysis` database & click **Refresh**. Choose **Schemas -> public -> Views** to see all views. When you right-click your new view & click **Properties**, you should see a more verbose version of the query (with the table name prepended to each column name) on the code tab in the dialogue that opens. That's a handy way to inspect view you might find in a database.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Inspecting Views.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This type of view -- one that isn't materialised -- holds no data at this point; instead, the stored `SELECT` query it contains will run when you access the view from another query. For example, the query below returns all columns in the view. As with a typical `SELECT` query, we can use `ORDER BY` to sort results, this time using the county's Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) code -- the standard designator the US Census Bureau & other federal agencies use to specify each county & state. We also add a `LIMIT` clause to display just five rows.\n",

    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We start the view definition with `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW`, followed by the name of the view & `AS`. The `SELECT` query names columns from the census tables & includes a column definition with a percent change calculation. Then we join the 2019 & 2010 census tables using the state & county FIPS codes. Run the query & the database should again respond with `CREATE VIEW`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we've created the view, we can use the query below to run a simple query using the new view that retrieves data for Nevada counties.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT county_name,\n",
    "       state_name,\n",

    "WHERE state_name = 'Nevada'\n",
    "ORDER BY county_fips\n",
    "LIMIT 5;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the query, we specify four of the `county_pop_change_2019_2010` view's seven columns. One is `pct_change_2019_2010`, which returns the result of the percent change calculation we're looking for. We're also filtering the results using a `WHERE` clause, similar to how we'd filter any query.\n",
    "\n",

    "Now we can revisit this view as often as we like to pull data for presentations or to answer questions about the percent change in population for any county in America from 2010 to 2019.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at just these five rows, you can see a couple of interesting stories emerge: the continued rapid growth of Clark County, which includes the city of Las Vegas, as well as a strong percent increase in Esmeralda County, one of the smallest counties in the United States & home to several ghost towns.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating & Refreshing a Materialised View\n",
    "\n",
    "A materialised view differs from a standard view in that upon its creation, the materialised view's stored query is executed, & the results it generates are saved in the database. In effect, this creates a new table. The view retains its stored query, so you can update the saved data by issuing a command to refresh the view. A good use for materialised views is to preprocess complex queries that take a while to run & make those results available for faster querying.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's drop the `nevada_counties_pop_2019` view & re-create it as a materialised view using the code in the query below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "DROP VIEW nevada_counties_pop_2019;\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW nevada_counties_pop_2019\n",
    "AS (\n",
    "    SELECT county_name,\n",

    "    WHERE state_name = 'Nevada';\n",
    ")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we use a `DROP VIEW` statement to remove the `nevada_counties_pop_2019` view from the database. Then, we run `CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW` to make the view. Notice that the syntax is the same as the one for making a standard view, except for the added `MATERIALIZED` keyword & the omission of `OR REPLACE`, which is not available in the materialised view syntax. After running the statement, the database should respond with the message `SELECT 17`, telling you that the view's query produced 17 rows to be stored in the view. We can noy query this data as with a standard view.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Creating a Materialised View.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say that the population estimates stored in `us_counties_pop_est_2019` are revised. To update the data stored in the materialised view, we can use the `REFRESH` keyword, as in the query below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW nevada_counties_pop_2019;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Executing this statement reruns the query stored in the `nevada_counties_pop_2019` view; the server will respond with the message `REFRESH MATERIALIZED VIEW`. The view will not reflect any updates to the data referenced by the view's query. When you have a query that takes some time to run, you can save time by storing its results in a materialised view that's refreshed periodically, letting users quickly access the stored data rather than run a length query.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Refreshing a Materialised View.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",

    "## Inserting, Updating, & Deleting Data Using a View\n",
    "\n",
    "With nonmaterialised views, you can update or insert data in the underlying table being queries as long as the view meets certain conditions. One requirement is that the view meets certain conditions. One requirement is that the view must reference a single table or updating view. If the view's query joins tables, as with the population change view we just built in the previous section, you can't perform inserts or updates to the original table directly. Also, the view's query can't contain `DISTINCT`, `WITH`, `GROUP BY` or other clauses. For a complete list of restrictions, see [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createview.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We already know how to directly insert & update data on a table, so why do it through a view? One reason is that a view is one way you can exercise control over which data a user can update.\n",

    "### Creating a View of Employees\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous lesson, we create & filled the `departments` & `employees` tables with four rows about people & where they work. Running a quick `SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY emp_id;` query shows the table's contents:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Viewing the employees Table.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say we want to use a view to give users in the Tax Department (its `dept_id` is `1`) the ability to add, remove, or update their employees' names without letting them change salary information or the data of employees in another department. To do this, we set up a view with the query below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW employees_tax_dept\n",
    "WITH (security_barrier)\n",

    "           dept_id\n",
    "    FROM employees\n",
    "    WHERE dept_id = 1\n",
    ")\n",
    "WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This view is similar to others we've created so far, but with a few additions. First, in the `CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW` statement, we add the keywords `WITH (security_barrier)`. This enables a level of database security to prevent a malicious user from getting around restrictions that the view places on rows & columns. See [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/rules-privileges.html) for how someone might subvert a view if you omit this type of security.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the view's `SELECT` query, we pick the columns we want to show from the `employees` table & use `WHERE` to filter the results on `dept_id = 1` to list only Tax Department staff. The view itself will restrict updates or deletes to rows matching the condition in the `WHERE` clause. Adding the keywords `WITH LOCAL CHECK OPTION` restricts inserts as well, allowing users to add new Tax Department employees only (if the view definition omitted these keywords, you could use it to insert a row with a `dept_id` of `3`, for example, which wouldn't be part of the Tax Department). The `LOCAL CHECK OPTION` also prevents a user from changing an employee's `dept_id` to a value other than `1`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create the employees_tax_dept_view by running the query. Then run `SELECT * FROM employees_tax_dept ORDER BY emp_id;`, which should provide these two rows:\n",

    "<img src = \"Viewing the employees_tax_dept View.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The result shows the employees who work in the Tax Department; they're two of the four rows in the entire `employees` table.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Inserting Rows Using the employees_tax_dept View\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use a view to insert or update data, but instead of using the table name in the `INSERT` or `UPDATE` statement, we substitute the view name. After we add or change data using a view, the change is applied to the underlying table, which in this case is `employees`. The view then reflects the change via the query it runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The query below shows two examples that attempt to add new employee records via the `employees_tax_dept` view. The first succeeds, but the second fails:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INSERT INTO employees_tax_dept (\n",
    "    emp_id, first_name, last_name, dept_id\n",

    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM employees ORDER BY emp_id;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first `INSERT`, we supply the first & last names of Suzanne Legere plus her `emp_id` & `dept_id`. Because the new row will satisfy the `LOCAL CHECK` in the view -- it contains the same columsn & `dept_id` is `1` -- the insert succeeds when it executes:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Successful & Rejected Inserts via the employees_tax_dept View 1.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "But when we run the query `INSERT` to add an employee named Jamil White using a `dept_id` of `2`, the operation fails with the error message `new row violates check option for view \"employees_tax_dept\"`. The reason is that when we created the view, we used a `WHERE` clause to return only rows with `dept_id = 1`. The `dept_id` of `2` doesn't pass the `LOCAL CHECK`, so it's prevented from being inserted.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Successful & Rejected Inserts via the employees_tax_dept View 2.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src = \"Successful & Rejected Inserts via the employees_tax_dept View 3.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",

    "<img src = \"Successful & Rejected Inserts via the employees_tax_dept View 4.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see from the addition of Suzanne Legere, the data we add using a view is also added to the underlying table. However, because the view doesn't include the `salary` column, the value in her row is `NULL`. If you attempt to insert a salary value using the view, you would receive the error message `column \"salary\" of relation \"employees_tax_dept\" does not exist`. The reason is that even though the `salary` column exists in the underlying `employees` table, it's not referenced in the view. Again, this is one way to limit access to sensitive data. We can also add `WITH (security_barrier)` if we plan to take on database administrator responsibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Updating Rows Using the employees_tax_dept View\n",
    "\n",
    "The same restrictions on access data in an underlying table apply when we update data using the `employees_tax_dept` view. The query below shows a standard query to change the spelling of Suzanne's last name using `UPDATE`.\n",
    "\n",

    "UPDATE employees_tax_dept\n",
    "SET last_name = 'Le Gere'\n",

    "\n",
    "Suzanne's last name is now correctly spelled as Le Gere, not Legere.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if we try to update the name of an employee who's not in the Tax Department, the query fails just as it did when we tried to insert Jamil White into the view. Try to use this view to update the salary of an employee -- even one in the Tax Department -- will also fail. If the view doesn't reference a column in the underlying table, you can't access that column through the view. Again, the fact that updates on views are restricted in this way offers ways to secure & hide certain pieces of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Deleting Rows Using the employees_tax_dept View\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's explore how to delete rows using a view. The restrictions on which data you can affect apply here as well. For example, if Suzanna Le Gere gets a better offer from another firm & decides to leave, you can remove her from `employees` through the `employees_tax_dept` view. Here is a query with the standard `DELETE` syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "DELETE FROM employees_tax_dept\n",
    "WHERE emp_id = 5;\n",

Each argument will serve as an input to the function & gets a name & data type. For example, `new_value` & `old_value` are `numeric` & require that the user of the function supply input values matching that type, whereas `decimal_places` (which specifies the number of places to round results) is `integer`.

So, everything between the pair of `$$` is the code that does the work. You can also add some text between the dollar signs, like `$namestring$`, to create a unique pair of beginning & ending quotes. This is useful, for example, if you need to quote a query inside the function.\n",

We subtract the `hire_date` from the current date, which is retrieved from the server by the `now()` function. Depending on which range `now() - hire_date` falls into, the `CASE` statement returns the number of personal days corresponding to the range. We use the PL/pgSQL keywords `RAISE NOTICE` to dispay a message that the procedure is done. Finally, we use the `LANGUAGE` keyword so the database knows to interpret what we've written according to the syntax specific to PL/pgSQL.\n",

    "Previously, we mentioned that PL/pgSQL is the default procedural language within PostgreSQL, but the database also supports creating functions using open source languages, such as Python & R. This support allows us to take advantage of features & modules from those languages within functions we create. For example, we can use the `pandas` library for analysis. The documentation here provides a comprehensive review of the languages included with PostgreSQL, but a comprehensive review of the languages included with PostgreSQL, but here we'll show a simple function using Python.\n",

    "\n",
    "After enabling the extension, we can create a function using syntax similar to the examples you've tried so far, but using Python for the body of the function. The query below shows how to use PL/Python to create a function called `trim_county()` that removesthe word *County* from the end of a string.

After the opening `$$` quotes, we get straight to the Python code, starting with a statement to import the Python regular expressions module, `re`. Even if you don't know much about Python, you can probably deduce that the next two lines of code set a variable called `cleaned` to the results of a Python regular expression function called `sub()`. That function looks for a space followed by the word *County* in the `input_string` passed into the function & substitutes an empty string, which is denoted by two apostrophes. Then the function returns the content of the variable `cleaned`. To end, we specify `LANGUAGE plpython3u` to note we're writing the function with PL/Python.\n",

Next, when you run `SELECT * FROM grades ORDER BY student_id, course_id;` you should see the grade data that you inserted, as shown here:\n",

    "<img src = \"Viewing the grades Table.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "That Biology 2 grade doesn't look very good. Let's update it using the code below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "UPDATE grades\n",
    "SET grade = 'C'\n",
    "WHERE student_id = 1 AND course_id = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run the `UPDATE`, pgAdmin doesn't display anything to let you know that the trigger executed in the background. It just reports `UPDATE 1`, meaning a row was updated. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Updating the grades Table.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "But our trigger did run, which we can confirm by examining columns in `grades_history` using this `SELECT` query:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT student_id,\n",
    "       change_time,\n",
    "       course,\n",

    "       new_grade\n",
    "FROM grades_history;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this query, you should see that the `grades_history` table, which contains all changes to grades, now has one row:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Viewing the grades_history Table.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This row displays the old Biology 2 grade of `F`, the new value `C`, & `change_time`, showing the time of update (your result should reflect your date & time). Note that the addition of this row to `grades_history` happened in the background without the knowledge of the person making the update. But the `UPDATE` event on the table caused the trigger to fire, which executed the `record_if_grade_changed()` function. Now we have a record of the change -- that's pretty cool. The ability to trigger actions on a database automatically gives us more control over our data.\n",

    "## Automatically Classifying Temperatures\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the SQL `CASE` statement to reclassify temperature readings into descriptive categories. The `CASE` statement is also part of the PL/pgSQL procedural language, & we can use its capability to assign values to variables to automatically store those category names in a table each time we add a temperature reading. If we're routinely collecting temperature readings, using this technique to automate the classification spares us from having to handle the task manually.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll follow the same steps we used for logging grade changes: we first create a function to classify the temperatures & then create a trigger to run the funciton each time the table is updated. Use the query below to create a `temperature_test` table for this exercise:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE temperature_test (\n",
    "    station_name text,\n",
    "    observation_date date,\n",
    "    max_temp integer,\n",
    "    min_temp integer,\n",
    "    max_temp_group text,\n",
    "    PRIMARY KEY (station_name, observation_date)\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `temperature_test` table contains columns to hold the name of the station & date of the temperature observation. Let's imagine that we have some process to insert a row once a day that provides the maximum & minimum temperature for that location, & we need to fill the `max_temp_group` column with a descriptive classification of the day's high reading to provide text to a weather forecast we're distributing.\n",
    "\n",
    "To do this, we first make a function called `classify_max_temp()`, as shown in the query below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION classify_max_temp()\n",
    "RETURNS trigger AS\n",
    "$$\n",
    "BEGIN\n",
    "    CASE WHEN NEW.max_temp >= 90 THEN\n",
    "             NEW.max_temp_group := 'Hot';\n",
    "         WHEN NEW.max_temp >= 70 AND NEW.max_temp < 90\n",
    "             THEN NEW.max_temp_group := 'Warm';\n",
    "         WHEN NEW.max_temp >= 50 AND NEW.max_temp < 70\n",
    "             THEN NEW.max_temp_group := 'Pleasant';\n",
    "         WHEN NEW.max_temp >= 33 AND NEW.max_temp < 50\n",
    "             THEN NEW.max_temp_group := 'Cold';\n",
    "         WHEN NEW.max_temp >= 20 AND NEW.max_temp < 33\n",
    "             THEN NEW.max_temp_group := 'Frigid';\n",
    "         WHEN NEW.max_temp < 20 THEN\n",
    "             NEW.max_temp_group := 'Inhumane';\n",
    "         ELSE NEW.max_temp_group := 'No Reading';\n",
    "    END CASE;\n",
    "    RETURN NEW;\n",
    "END;\n",
    "$$\n",
    "LANGUAGE plpgsql;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "By now, these functions should look familiar. What's new here is PL/pgSQL version of the `CASE` syntax, which differs slightly from the SQL syntax. The PL/pgSQL syntax includes a semicolon after each `WHEN ... THEN` clause. Also new is the *assignment operator* `:=`, which we use to assign the descriptive name to the `NEW.max_temp_group` column based on the outcome of the `CASE` function. For example, the statement `NEW.max_temp_group := 'Cold'` assigns the string `'Cold'` to `NEW.max_temp_group` when the temperature value is greater than or equal to 33 degrees but less than 50 degrees Fahrenheit. When the function returns the `NEW` row to be inserted in the table, it will include the string value `Cold`. Run the code to create the function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, using the code below, we can create a trigger to execute the function each time a row is added to `temperature_test`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "CREATE TRIGGER temperature_insert\n",
    "BEFORE INSERT ON temperature_test\n",
    "FOR EACH ROW\n",
    "EXECUTE PROCEDURE classify_max_temp();\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we classify `max_temp` & create a value for `max_temp_group` prior to inserting the row into the table. Doing so is more efficient than performing a separate update after the row is inserted. To specify that behaviour, we set the `temperature_insert` trigger to fire `BEFORE INSERT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also want the trigger to fire `FOR EACH ROW` because we want each `max_temp` recorded in the table to get a decriptive classification. The final `EXECUTE PROCEDURE` statement names the `classify_max_temp()` function we just created. Run the `CREATE TRIGGER` statement in pgAdmin, & then test the setup using the query below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "INSERT INTO temperature_test\n",
    "VALUES ('North Station', '1/19/2023', 10, -3),\n",
    "       ('North Station', '3/20/2023', 28, 19),\n",
    "       ('North Station', '5/2/2023', 65, 42),\n",
    "       ('North Station', '8/9/2023', 93, 74),\n",
    "       ('North Station', '12/14/2023', NULL, NULL);\n",
    "\n",
    "SELECT * FROM temperature_test\n",
    "ORDER BY observation_date;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we insert five rows into `temperature_test`, & we expect the `temperature_insert` trigger to fire for each row -- & it does! The `SELECT` statement in the listing should display these results:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Inserting Rows to Test the temperature_insert Trigger.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Thanks to the trigger & function, each `max_temp` inserted automatically receives the appropriate classification in the `max_temp_group` column -- including the instance where we had no reading for that value. Note that the trigger's update of the column will override any user-supplied values during insert.\n",
    "\n",
    "This temperature example & the earlier grade_change auditing example are rudimentary, but they give you a glimpse of how useful triggers & functions can be in simplifying data maintenance."
