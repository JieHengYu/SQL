    "1. Create a materialised view that displays the number of New York City taxi trips per hour. Use the taxi data from the table `nyc_yellow_taxi_trips`. How do you refresh the view if you needed to?\n",
    "2. Create a formula `rate_per_thousand()` that takes three arguments to calculate the result: `observed_number`, `base_number`, & `decimal_places`.\n",
    "3. Write a trigger for the `meat_poultry_egg_establishments` table that adds an inspection deadline timestamp six months in the future whenever you insert a new facility into the table. Use the `inspection_deadline` column. You should be able to describe the steps needed to implement a trigger & how the steps relate to each other."
