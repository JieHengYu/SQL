    "# Basic SELECT Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a `SELECT` statement that fetches every row & column in a table called `my_table`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT * FROM my_table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This single line of code shows the most basic form of a SQL query. The asterisk following the `SELECT` keyword is called a *wildcard*, which is like a stand-in for a value; it doesn't represent anything in particular & instead represents everything that value could possibly be. Here, it's shorthad for \"select all columns\". If you had given a column name instead of a wildcard, this command would select the values in that column. The `FROM` keyword indicates you want the query to return data from a particular table. The semicolon after the table name tells PostgreSQL it's the end of the query statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's use this `SELECT` statement with the asterisk wildcard on the `teachers` table we created in the previous lesson. Once again, open Postgres.app & pgAdmin, select the `analysis` database, & open the Query Tool. Then execute the following statement.\n",

    "\n",
    "There are actually two other ways to view all rows in a table using pgAdmin. You can right-click the `teachers` in the object tree & choose **View/Edit Data -> All Rows**. Or you can use a little known bit of standard SQL:\n",
    "\n",

    "<img src = \"View teachers Table Using Standard SQL.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "## Querying a Subset of Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "Often, it's more practical to limit the columns the query retrieves, especially with large databases, so you don't have to wade through excess information. You can do this by naming columns, separated by commas, right after the `SELECT` keyword. Here's an example\"\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT some_column, another_column, amazing_column\n",
    "FROM table_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "With that syntax, the query will retrieve all rows from just those three columns. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's apply this to the `teachers` table. Perhaps in your analysis you want to focus on teachers' names & salaries. In that case, you would select just the relevant columns. Notice that the order of the columns in the query is different than the order in the table: you're able to retrieve columns in any order you'd like.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT last_name, first_name, salary\n",
    "FROM teachers;\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Querying Subset of Columns.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Although these examples are basic, they illustrate a good strategy for beginning your interview of a dataset. Generally, it's wise to start your analysis by checking whether your data is present & in the format you expect, which is a task well suited to `SELECT`. \n",
    "\n",
    "We're only working with a table of six rows, but when you're facing a table of thousands or eve millions of rows, it's essential to get a quick read on your data quality & the range of values it contains. \n",

    "In SQL, we order the results of a query using a clause containing the keywords `ORDER BY` followed by the name of the column or columns to sort. Applying this clause doesn't change th original table, only the result of the query. Below is an example using the `teachers` table.\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Sorting a Column with ORDER BY.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The `ORDER BY` column also accepts numbers instead of column names, with the number identifying the sort column according to its position in the `SELECT` clause. Thus, you could rewrite the above SQL statement in this way, using `3` to refer to the third column in the `SELECT` clause, `salary`:\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "SELECT last_name, school, hire_date\n",
    "FROM teachers\n",
    "ORDER BY school ASC, hire_date DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, we're retrieving the last names of teachers, their school, & the date they were hired. By sorting the `school` column in ascending order & `hire_date` in descending order, we create a listing of teachers grouped by school with the most recently hired teachers listed first. This shows us who the newest teachers are at each school. \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Sorting Multiple Columns with ORDER BY.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "You can use `ORDER BY` on more than two columns, but you'll soon reach a point of diminishing returns where the effect will be hardly noticeable. Therefore, a better strategy is to limit the number of columns in your query to only the most important, & then run several queries to answer each question you have."

    "\n",
    "The first query uses `AND` in the `WHERE` clause to find teachers who work at Myers Middle School & have a salary less than \\\\$40,000.

    "<img src = \"Filtering with OR Operator.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",

    "The final example looks for teachers at Roosevelt whose salaries are either less than \\\\$38,000 or greater than \\\\$40,000.
