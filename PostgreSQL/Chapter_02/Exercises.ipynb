    "Here are two exercises to help you explore concepts related to databases, tables & data relationships:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building a database to catalog all the animals at your local zoo. You want one table to track the kinds of animals in the collection & another table to track the specifics on each animal. Write `CREATE TABLE` statements for each table that include some of the columns you need. Why did you include the columns you chose?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, create `INSERT` statements to load sample data into the tables. how can you view the data via the pgAdmin tool? Create an additional `INSERT` statement for one of your tables. Purposely omit one of the required commas separationg the entries in the `VALUES` clause of the query. What is the error message? Would it help you find the error in the code?"

As for the rest of the features, I included them to see the taxonomic distinction between different animals.\n",
