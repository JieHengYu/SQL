    "\n",
    "1. The earthquakes JSON has a key `tsunami` that's set to a value of `1` for large earthquakes in oceanic regions (though it doesn't mean a tsunami actually happened). Using either path or field extraction operators, find earthquakes with a `tsunami` value of `1` & include their location, time, & magnitude in your results.\n",
    "2. Use the following `CREATE TABLE` statement to add the table `earthquakes_from_json` to your `analysis` database. Using field & path extraction operators, write an `INSERT` statement to fill the table with the correct value for each earthquake.\n",

    "    id text PRIMARY KEY,\n",

    "3. Try writing a query to generate the following JSON using the data in the `teachers` & `teachers_lab_access` tables from previous lessons. It's helpful to remember that the `teachers` table has a one-to-many reationships with `teachers_lab_access`; the first three keys must come from `teachers`, & the JSON objects in the array of `lab_access` will come from `teachers_lab_access`. Hint: you'll need to use a subquery in your `SELECT` list & a function called `json_agg()` to create the `lab_access` array.\n",
