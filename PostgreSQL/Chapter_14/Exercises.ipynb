    "1. The style guide of a publishing company you're writing for wants you to avoid commas before suffixes in names. But there are several names like `Alvarez, Jr.` & `Williams, Sr.` in your database. Which functions can you use to remove the comma? Would a regular expression function help? How would you capture just the suffixes to place them into a separate column?\n",
    "2. Using any one of the presidents' speeches, count the number of unique words that are five characters or more. (Hint: You can use `regexp_split_to_table()` in a subquery to create a table of words to count.) Bonus: Remove commas & periods at the end of each word.\n",
    "3. Rewrite the below query using the `ts_rank_cd()` function instead of `ts_rank()`. According to PostgreSQL documentation, `ts_rank_cd()` computes cover density, which takes into account how close the lexeme search terms are to each other. Does using the `ts_rank_cd()` function significantly change the results?\n",

    "We could use the `replace()` function.
