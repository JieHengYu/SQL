    "1. Using the New York City taxi data, calculate the length of each ride using the pickup & drop-off timestamps. Sort the query results from the longest ride to the shortest. Do you notice anything about the longest or shortest trips that you might want to ask city officials about?\n",
    "2. Using the `AT TIME ZONE` keywords, write a query that displays the date & time for London, Johannesburg, Moscow, & Melbourne the moment January 1, 2100, arrives in New York City.\n",
    "3. As a bonus challenge, calculate the correlation coefficient & r-squared values using trip time duration & the `total_amount` column in the New York City taxi data, which represents the total amount charged to passengers. Do the same with the `trip_distance` & `total_amount` columns. Limit the query to rides that last three hours or less."
