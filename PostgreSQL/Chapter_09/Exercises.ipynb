    "Put your grouping & aggregating skills to the test with these challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We saw that library visits have declined recently in most places. But what is the pattern in library employment? All three library survey tables contain the column `totstaff`, which is the number of paid full-time equivalent employees. Calculate the percentage change in the sum of the column over time, examining all states as well as states with the most visitors. Watch out for negative values!\n",
    "2. The library survey tables contain a column called `obereg`, a two-digit Bureau of Economic Analysis Code that classifies each library agency according to a region of the United States, such as New England, Rocky Mountains, & so on. Just as we calculated the percent change in visits grouped by state, do the same to group percent changes in visits by US region using `obereg`. Consult the survey documentation to find the meaning in each region code. For a bonus challenge, create a table with the `obereg` code as the primary key & the region name as text, & join it to the summary query to group by the region name rather than the code.\n",
    "3. Thinking back on the types of joins you've learned, which join type will show you all the rows in all three tables, including those without a match? Write such a query & add an `IS NULL` filter in a `WHERE` clause to show agencies not included in one or more tables."
