    "* **Polygon**\n",
    "   - A two-dimensional shape with three or more straight sides, each constructed from a LineString. On maps, Polygons represent objects such as nations, states, buildings, & bodies of water. A Polygon can have one or more Polygons that act as holes inside a larger Polygon.\n",

    "   - A set of Points. A single MultiPoint object could represent multiple locations of a retail with each store's latitude & longitude.\n",
    "* **MultiLineString**\n",

    "* **MultiPolygon**\n",

    "Representing Earth's spherical surface on a two-dimensional map is not easy. Thus, what cartographers do is create a map *projection* on its own *projected coordinate system*. A projection is simply a flattened representation of the globe with its own two-dimensional coordinate system.\n",
    "\n",
    "Projections are derived from *geographic coordinate systems*, which define the grid of latitude, longitude, & height of any point on the globe along with factors including Earth's shape. Whenever you obtain geographic data, it's critical to know the coordinate systems it references so you provide the correct information when writing queries. Often, user documentation will name the coordinate system.\n",

    "\n",
    "When using PostGIS (& other GIS applications), you specify the coordinate system via its unique SRID.

The table also contains the column `srtext`, which includes a WKT representation of the spatial reference system plus other metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll be using SRID `4326`, the ID for the geographic coordinate system WGS 84. That's the most recent World Geodetic System (WGS) standard used by GPS. You can see the WKT representation for WGS 84 by running the query below:\n",

    "\n",
    "We won't need to use this information for this lesson's exercises, but we can get to know some of the variables & how the define the projection. `GEOGCS` provides the geographic coordinate system in use. `PRIMEM` specifies the location of the *prime meridian*, or longitude 0.\n",

    "\n",
    "* **geography:** A data type based on a sphere, using the round-Earth coordinate system (longitude & latitude). All calculations occur on the globe, taking its curvature into account. This makes the math complex & limits the number of functions available to work with the `geography` type. but because Earth's curvature is factored in, calculations for distance are more precies; you should use the `geography` data type when handling data that spans large areas. The results from calculations on the `geography` type will be expressed in meters.\n",
    "* **geometry:** A data type based on a plane, using the Euclidean coordinate system. Calculations occur on straight lines as opposed to along the curvature of a sphere, making calculations for geographical distance less precise than with the `geography` data type; the results of calculations are expressed in units of whichever coordinate system you've designated.\n",

In short, if you're working strictly with longitude/latitude data or if your data covers a large area, such as a continent or globe, use the `geography` type, even though it limits the functions you can use. If your data covers a smaller area, the `geometry` type provides more functions & better performance. You can also convert one type to the other using `CAST`."

    "Next, we run a standard `UPDATE` statement to fill the `geog_point` column. Nested inside an `ST_SetSRID()` function, the `ST_MakePoint()` function takes as input the `longitude` & `latitude` columns from the table. The output, which is the `geometry` type of default, must be case to `geography` to match the `geog_point` column type.

    "## Adding a Spatial Index\n",

    "We add an index to the new column to speed up queries. PostgreSQL's default index is the B-tree. A B-tree index is useful for data that you can order & search using equality & range oeprators, but it's less useful for spatial objects. The reason is that you cannot easily sort GIS data along one axis. For example, the application has no way to determine which of these coordinate pairs is greatest: (0, 0), (0, 1) or (1, 0).\n",

For example, we may want to find the closest farmers' market regardless of whether it's 10 kilometers away or 100. To do that, we can instruct PostGIS to implement a *K-nearest-neighbours* search algorithm by using the `<->` distance operator in the `ORDER BY ` clause of the query. Nearest neighbours algorithms solve a range of classification problems by identifying similar items -- text recognition is an example. In this case, PostGIS will identify some number of spatial objects, represented by `K`, nearest to an object we specify.\n",

    "# Working with Census Shapefiles\n",
    "\n",
    "A *shapefile* is a GIS data file format developed by Esri, a US company known for its ArcGIS mapping visualisation & analysis platform. Shapefiles are a standard file format for GIS platforms -- such as ArcGIS & the open source QGIS -- & are used by governments, corporations, nonprofits, & technical organisations to display, analyse, & distribute data with geographic features.\n",
    "\n",
    "Shapefiles hold information describing the shape of a feature (such as a county, a road, or a lake) plus a database with each feature's attributes. Those attributes might include their name & other demographic descriptors. A single shapefile can contain only one type of shape, such as polygons or points, & when you load a shapefile into a GIS platform that supports visualisation, you can view the shapes & query their attributes. PostgreSQL, with the PostGIS extension, lets you query the spatial data in the shapefile.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Understanding the Contents of a Shapefile\n",
    "\n",
    "A shapefile comprises a collection of files with different extensions, each with a different purpose. Often, when you download a shapefile, it comes in a compressed archive, such as *.zip*. You'll need to unzip it to access the individual files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Per ArcGIS documentation, these are the most common extensions you'll encounter:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **.shp:** Main file that stores the feature geometry.\n",
    "* **.shx:** Index file that stores the index of the feature geometry.\n",
    "* **.dbf:** Database table (in dBASE format) that stores the attribute information of features.\n",
    "* **.xml:** XML-format file that stores metadata about the shapefile.\n",
    "* **.prj:** Projection file that stores the coordinate system information. You can open this file with a text editor to view the geographic coordinate system & projection.\n",
    "\n",
    "According to the documentation, files with the first three extensions include necessary data required for working with a shapefile. The other file types are optional. You can load a shapefile into PostGIS to access its spatial objects & attributes for each. \n",
    "\n",
    "*tl_2019_us_county.zip* from the lesson's materials contains files including the extensions listed above. Unzip it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Loading Shapefile\n",
    "\n",
    "For macOS, we'll use the command line application `shp2pgsql`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing Shapefiles using shp2pgsql\n",
    "\n",
    "The Shapefile Import/Export Manager isn't available on all PostGIS distributions for macOS & Linux. For this reason, we'll use the PostGIS commad line tool `shp2pgsql`, which lets you accomplish the same thing using a single text command.\n",
    "\n",
    "On macOS & Linux, we execute command line tools in the Terminal application. At the command line, you use the following syntax to import a shapefile into a new table:\n",

    "shp2pgsql -I -s SRID -W encoding shapefile_name table_name |\n",
    "psql -d database -U user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot's happening here. Let's look at each argument following the command:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `-I` adds an index on the new table's geometry column using GiST.\n",
    "* `-s` lets you specify an SRID for the geometric data.\n",
    "* `-W` lets you specify file encoding, if necessary.\n",
    "* `shape_file_name` is the name (including full path) of the file ending with the *.shp* extension.\n",
    "* `table_name` indicates the next table you want the shapefile imported to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these arguments, you place a  pipe symbol (`|`) to direct the output of `shp2pgsql` to `psql`, the PostgreSQL command line utility. That's followed by arguments for naming the database & user. For example, to load the *tl_2019_us_county.shp* shapefile from the lesson's resources into a `us_counties_2019_shp` table in the `analysis` database, in your terminal you would move to the directory containing the shapefile & run the following command (all on one line):\n",
