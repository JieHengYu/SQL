    "Use the spatial data you've imported in this lesson to try the below analyses:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Earlier, you found which US county has the largest area. Now, aggregate the county data to find the area of each state in square miles. (Use the `statefp` column in the `us_counties_2019_shp` table.) How many states are bigger than the Yukon-Koyukuk area?\n",
    "2. Using `ST_Distance()`, determine how many miles separate these two farmers' markets: The Oakleaf Greenmarket (9700 Argyle Forest Blvd, Jacksonville, Florida) & Columbia Farmers Market (1701 West Ash Street, Columbia, Missouri). You'll need to first find the coordinates for both in the `farmers_markets` table.\n",
    "3. More than 500 rows in the `farmers_markets` table are missing a value in the `county` column, which is an example of dirty government data. Using the `us_counties_2019_shp` table & the `ST_Intersects()` function, perform a spatial join to find the missing county names based on the longitude & latitude of each market. Because `geog_point` in `farmers_markets` is of the `geography` type & its SRID is `4326`, you'll need to cast `geom` in the census table to the `geography` type & change its SRID using `ST_SetSRID()`.\n",
    "4. The `nyc_yellow_taxi_trips` table contains the longitude & latitude where each trip began & ended. Use PostGIS functions to turn the drop-off cordinates into a `geometry` type & count the state/county pairs where each drop_off occurred. As with the previous exercise, you'll need to join to the `us_counties_2019_shp` table & use its `geom` column for the spatial join."
