    "# Using PostgreSQL From The Command Line\n",
    "\n",
    "The command line -- also called *command line interface*, *console*, a *shell*, or the *terminal* -- existed long before computers had graphical user interface (GUI) with menus, icons, & buttons you could click for navigation. Today, even in a GUI world, familiarity with the command line is essential for a programmer moving toward expert-level skills. \n",
    "\n",
    "As we learn about this text-only world, pay attention to these advantages of mastering working from the command line instead of a GUI, such as pgAdmin: we can often work faster by entering short commands instead of clicking through layers of menu items. You can also gain access to functions that only the command line provides. If the command line access is all you have to work with (for example, when we've connected to a remote computer), we can still get work done.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use `psql`, a command-line tool included with PostgreSQL that lets us run queries, manage database objects, & interact with the computer's operating system via text command."

    "# Working with psql\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that you've identified your command line interface & set it up to recognise the location of `psql`, let's launch `psql` & connect to a database on our local installation of PostgreSQL. Then, we'll explore executing queries & special commands for retrieving database information.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Launching psql & Connecting to a Database\n",
    "\n",
    "Regardless of the operating system you're using, you start `psql` in the same way. Open your command line interface (Terminal on macOS). To launch `psql` & connect to a database, we use the following pattern at the command prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "psql -d database_name -U user_name\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Following the `psql` application name, we provide the database name after a `-d` database argument & a username after the `-U` username argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the database name, we'll use `analysis`, which is where we created our tables & other objects for the book's exercises. For username, we'll use `postgres`, which is the default user created during installing. So, to connect to the `analysis` database on your local server, we'll enter this into the command line (Make sure postgres is running):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "psql -d analysis -U postgres\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you can connect to a database on a remote server by specifying the `-h` argument followed by the hostname. For example, you would use the following line if you were connecting to a database named `analysis` on a server called `example.com`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "psql -d analysis -U postgres -h example.com\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Either way, if you set a password during installation, you should receive a password prompt when `psql` launches. If so, enter your password. After `psql` connects to the database, you should then see a prompt that looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "psql (17.2)\n",
    "Type \"help\" for help.\n",
    "\n",
    "analysis=#\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the first line lists the version number of `psql` & the server you're connected to. Your version will vary depending on when you installed PostgreSQL. The prompt where you'll enter commands is `analysis=#`, which refers to the name of the database, followed by an equal sign (`=`) & a hash mark (`#`). The has mark indicates that you're logged in with *superuser* privileges, which give you unlimited ability to access & create objects & set up accounts & security. If you're logged in as a user without superuse privileges, the last character of the prompt will be a greater-than sign (`>`). As you can see, the user account you logged in with here (`postgres`) is a superuser.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Connecting to the analysis Database on our Local Postgres Server.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Getting Help or Exiting\n",
    "\n",
    "At the `psql` prompt, you can get help for both `psql` & general SQL with a set of *meta-commands*, detailed in the table below. Meta-command, which beings with a backslash (`\\`), go beyond offering help -- we'll cover several that return information about the database, let you adjust settings, or process data.\n",
    "\n",
    "|Command|Displays|\n",

    "|`\\h`|List of SQL commands. Add a command name to see detailed help for it (for example, `\\h INSERT`)|\n",
    "\n",
    "Even experienced users often need a refresher on commands & options, so having the details in the `psql` application is handy. To exit `psql`, use the meta-command `\\q` (for *quit*).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Changing the Database Connection\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with SQL, it's not unusual to be working with multiple databases, so you need a way to switch between databases. You can do this easily at the `psql` prompt using the `\\c` meta-command.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, while connected to your `analysis` database, at the `psql` prompt enter the following command to create a database named `test`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "analysis=# CREATE DATABASE test;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Then, to connect to the new `test` database you just created, enter `\\c` followed by the name of the database at the `psql` prompt (& provide your PostgreSQL password if asked):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "analysis=# \\c test\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The application should respond with the following message:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Creating a Database & Changing the Database Connection.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The prompt will show you which database you're connected to.\n",
    "\n",
    "To reduce clutter, you can remove the `test` database you created. First use `\\c` to disconnect from `test` & connect to the `analysis` database (we can remove a database only if no one is connected to it). Once you've connected to `analysis`, enter `DROP DATABASE test;` at the `psql` prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Running SQL Queries on psql\n",
    "\n",
    "We've configured `psql` & connected to a database, so now let's run some SQL queries. We'll start with a single-line query & then run a multiple-line query.\n",
    "\n",
    "We enter SQL into the `psql` directly at the prompt. For example, to see a few rows form the 2019 census table we've used throughout this course, enter a query at the prompt as shown:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "analysis=# SELECT county_name FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019 ORDER BY county_name LIMIT 3;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Press ENTER to execute the query, & `psql` should display the following results in your terminal in text including the number of rows returned:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Entering a Single-Line Query in psql.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Below the result, you can see the `analysis=#` prompt again, ready for further input. You can use the up & down arrows on your keyboard to scroll through recent queries & press ENTER to execute them again, avoiding having to retype them.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Entering a Multiline Query\n",
    "\n",
    "You're not limited to single-line queries. If you have a query that spans multiple lines, you can enter lines one at a time, pressing ENTER after each, & `psql` knows not to execute the query until you provide a semicolon. Let's reenter the previous query over multiple lines, shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "analysis=# SELECT county_name\n",
    "analysis=# FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019\n",
    "analysis=# ORDER BY county_name\n",
    "analysis=# LIMIT 3;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when your query extends past one line, the symbol between the database name & the hash mark changes from an equal sign to a hyphen. This multiline query executes only when you press ENTER after the final line, which ends with a semicolon.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Entering a Multiline Query in psql.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Checking for Open Parentheses in the psql Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Another helpful feature of psql is that is shows when you haven't closed a pair of parentheses. The query below shows this action:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "analysis=# CREATE TABLE wineries (\n",
    "analysis=# id bigint,\n",
    "analysis=# winery_name text\n",
    "analysis=# );\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, we create a simplet able called `wineries` that has two columns. After entering the first line of the `CREATE TABLE` statement & an open parentheses., the prompt then changes from `analysis=#` to `analysis(#` to include open parenthesis. This reminds us an open parenthesis needs closing. The prompt maintains that configuration until we add the closing parenthesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Showing Open Parentheses in the psql Prompt.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Navigating & Formatting Results\n",
    "\n",
    "The queries we ranso far return only one column & a handful of rows, so its output was contained nicely in our command line interface. But for queries with more columns or rows, the output can fill more than one screen, making it difficult to navigate. Fortunately, you have several ways to customise the display style of the output using the `\\pset` meta-command.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting Paging of Results\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to adjust the output format is to specify how `psql` handles scrolling through lengthy query results, known as *paging*. By deafult, if your results return more rows than will fit on one screen, `psql` will display the first screen's worth of rows & then let you scroll through the rest. For example, the query below shows what happens at the `psql` prompt when we remove the `LIMIT` clause from the query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "analysis=# SELECT county_name FROM us_counties_pop_est_2019 ORDER BY county_name;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"A Query with Scrolling Results 1.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that this table has 3,142 rows. The result only shows the first couple of rows on the screen (the number of visible rows depends on your terminal configuration). On macOS, the indicator will be a colon. Scrolling though a few thousand rows will take a while. Press Q to exit the results & return to the `psql` prompt.\n",
    "\n",
    "To bypass manual scrolling & have all your results immediately display, you can change the `pager` setting using the `\\pset pager` meta-command. Run that command at your `psql` prompt, & it should return the message `Pager usage is off`. Now when you rerun the query with the `pager` setting turned off, you should see results like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"A Query with Scrolling Results 2.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Formatting the Results Grid\n",
    "\n",
    "You also can use `\\pset` with the following options to format the results:\n",
    "\n",
    "### border int\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this option to specify whether the results grid has no border (`0`), internal lines dividing columns (`1`), or lines around all cells (`2`). For example, `\\pset border 2` sets lines around all cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "### format unaligned\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the option `\\set format unaligned` to display the results in lines separated by a delimiter rather than in columns, similar to what you would see in a CSV file. The separator defaults to a pipe symbol (`|`). You can set a different separator using the `fieldsep` command. For example, to set a comma as the separator, run `\\pset filedsep ','`. To revert to a column view, run `\\pset format aligned`. You can use the `psql` meta-command `\\a` to toggle between aligned & unaligned views.\n",
    "\n",
    "### footer\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this option to toggle the results footer, which displays the result row count, on or off.\n",
    "\n",
    "### null\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this option to set how `psql` displays `NULL` values. By default, they show as blanks. You can run `\\pset null '(null)'` to replace blanks with `(null)` when the column value is `NULL`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Viewing Expanded Results\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes, it's helpful to view results arranged not in the typical table style of rows & columns, but instead in a vertical list. This is useful when the number of rows is too big to fit on-screen in the normal horizontal results grid & also for scanning values in columns row by row. In `psql`, you can switch to a vertical list view using the `\\x` (for *expanded*) meta-command. The best way to understand the difference between normal & expanded view is by looking at the example. Below shows the normal display you see when querying the `grades` table using `psql`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Normal Display of the grades Table Query.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To change to the expanded view, enter `\\x` at the `psql` prompt, which should display the message `Expanded display is on`. Then when you run the same query again, you should see the expanded results: as shown below:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Expanded Display of the grades Table Query.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The results appear in vertical blocks separated by record numbers. Depending on your needs & the type of data you're working with, this format might be easier to read. You can revert to column display by enter `\\x` again at the `psql` prompt. In addition, setting `\\x auto` will make PostgreSQL automatically display the results in a table or expanded view based on the size of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Meta-Commands for Database Information\n",
    "\n",
    "You can have `psql` display details about databases, tables, & other objects via a particular set of meta-commands. To see how these work, we'll explore the meta-command that displays the tables in your database, including how to append a plus sign (`+`) to the command to expand the output & add an optional pattern to filter the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "To see a list of tables, you can enter `\\dt` at the `psql` prompt. Here's a snippet of the output.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Seeing a List of Tables.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This result lists all tables in the current database alphabetically. You can filter the output by adding a pattern the database object name must match. For example, use `\\dt us*` to show only tables whose names begin with `us` (the asterisk acts as a wildcard). The results should look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Listing Tables That Begin with us.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The table below shows several additional commands you might find helpful, including `\\l`, which lists the databases on your server. Adding a plus sign to each command, as in `\\dt+`, adds more information to the output, including object sizes.\n",

    "|`\\dx [pattern]`|Installed extensions|\n",
    "|`\\l [pattern]`|Databases|\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire list of commands is available in the PostgreSQL documentation at [https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-psql.html), or you can see details by using the `\\?` command noted earlier.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Importing, Exporting & Using Files\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use `psql` to import & export data from the command line, which can be necessary when you're connected to remote servers, such as Amazon Web Services instances of PostgreSQL. We'll also use `psql` to read & execute SQL commands stored in a file & learn the syntax for sending `psql` output to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Using \\copy for Import & Export\n",
    "\n",
    "Previously, we learned how to use the PostgreSQL `COPY` command to import & export data. It's a straightforward process, but it has one significant limitation: the file you're importing or exporting must be on the same machine as the PostgreSQL server. That's fine if you're working on your local machine, as you've been doing with these exercises. but if you're connecting to a database on a remote computer, you might not have access to its file system. You can get around this restriction by using the `\\copy` meta-command in `psql`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `\\copy` meta-command works just like PostgreSQL `COPY`, except when you execute it at the `psql` prompt, it will route data from your machine to the server you're connected to, whether local or remote. We won't actually connect to a remote server to try this since it's rare to find a public remote server we would connect to, but you can still learn the syntax by using the commands on our local `analysis` database.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the `psql` prompt, we use a `DELETE` statement to remove all the rows from the small `state_regions` table & then import data using `\\copy`. You'll need to change the file path to match the location of the file on your computer:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "DELETE FROM state_regions;\n",
    "\\copy state_regions FROM '/YourDirectory/state_regions.csv' WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Importing Data using \\copy.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, to import the data, we use `\\copy` with the same syntax used with PostgreSQL `COPY`, including a `FROM` clause with the file path on your machine, & a `WITH` clause that specifies the file is a CSV & has a header row. When we execute the statement, the server responds with `COPY 56`, letting us know the rows have been successfully imported. \n",
    "\n",
    "If you're connected to a remote server via `psql`, you would use the same `\\copy` syntax, & the command would route your local file to the remote server for importing. In this example, we used `\\copy FROM` to import a file. We could also use `\\copy TO` for exporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Passing SQL Commands to psql\n",
    "\n",
    "By placing a command in quotes after the `-c` argument, we can send it to our connected server, local or remote. The command can be a single SQL statement, multiple SQL statements separated by semicolons, or meta-command. This can allow us to run `psql`, connect to a server, & execute a command in a single command line statement -- handy if we want to incorporate `psql` statements in to shell scripts to automate tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can import data to the `state_regions` table with the statement below: which must be entered on one line in our command prompt (& not inside `psql`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "psql -d analysis -U postgres -c 'COPY state_regions FROM STDIN WITH (FORMAT CSV, HEADER);' </YourDirectory/state_regions.csv\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To try it, you'll need to first run `DELETE FROM state_regions;` inside `psql` to clear the table. Then exit `psql` by typing the meta-command `\\q`.\n",
    "\n",
    "At your command prompt, enter the statement above. We first use `psql` & the `-d` & `-U` commands to connect to your `analysis` database. Then comes the `-c` command, which we follow with the PostgreSQL statement for importing the data. The statement is similar to `COPY` statements we've used with one exception: after `FROM`, we use the keyword `STDIN` instead of the complete file path & filename. `STDIN` means \"standard input\", which is a stream of input data that can come from a device, a keyboard, or in this case the file *state_regions.csv*, which we direct to `psql` using the the less-than (`<`) symbol. You'll need to supply the full path to the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Running this entire command at your command prompt should import the CSV file & generate the message `COPY 56`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src = \"Importing Data Using psql With COPY.png\" width = \"600\" style = \"margin:auto\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Saving Query Output to a File\n",
    "\n",
    "It's sometimes helpful to save the query results & messages generated during a `psql` session to a file, such as to keep a history of your work or to use the output in a spreadsheet or other application. To send query output to a file, you can use the `\\o` meta-command along with the full path & name of tan output file that `psql` will create.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, we can change the `psql` format style from a table to CSV & then output query results directly to a file.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "analysis=# \\pset format csv\n",
    "analysis=# SELECT * FROM grades ORDER BY student_id, course_id;\n",
    "analysis=# \\o '/YourDirectory/query_output.csv'\n",
    "analysis=# SELECT * FROM grades ORDER BY student_id, course_id;\n",
    "```\n",

For repetitive tasks, this workflow can save considerable time because you avoid launching pgAdmin or rewriting a query. You can also stack multiple queries in the file so they run in succession, which for example, you might do if you want to run several updates on your database."

    "# Additional Command Line Utilities to Expedite Tasks\n",
    "\n",
    "PostgreSQL has its own set of command line utilities that you can enter in your command line interface without launching `psql`. Here, we'll cover two that are particularly useful: creating a database at the command line with the `createdb` utility & loading shapefiles into a PostGIS database via the `shp2pgsql` utility.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Adding a Database with createdb\n",
    "\n",
    "Earlier in this lesson, we used `CREATE DATABASE` to add the database `test` to our PostgreSQL server. We can achieve the same thing using `createdb` at the command line. For example, to create a new database on your server named `box_office`, run the following at your command line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "createdb -U postgres -e box_office\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `-U` argument tells the command to connect to the PostgreSQL server using the `postgres` account. The `-e` argument (for *echo*) prints the commands generated by `createdb` as output. Running this comand creates the database & prints output to the screen ending with `CREATE DATABASE box_office;` You can then connect to the new database via `psql` using the following line:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "psql -d box_office -U postgres\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `createdb` command accepts arguments to connect to a remote server (just like `psql` does) & to set options for the new database. A full list of arguments is available [here](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/app-createdb.html). Again, the `createdb` command is a time-saver that comes in handy when you don't have access to a GUI.\n",

    "## Loading Shapefiles with shp2pgsql\n",
    "\n",
    "In a previous lesson, we learned about shapefiles, which contain data describing spatial objects. On Windows & some Linux distributions, you can import shapefiles into a PostGIS-enabled database using the Shapefile Import/Export Manager GUI tool included with PostGIS. However, the Shapefile Import/Export Manager is not always included with PostGIS on macOS or some flavor of Linux. In those cases (or if you'd rather work at the command line), you can import a shapefile using the PostGIS command line tool `shp2pgsql`.\n",
    "\n",
    "To import a shapefile into a new table from the command line, use the following syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "shp2pgsql -I -s SRID -W encoding shapefile_name table_name | psql -d database -U user\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A lot is happening in this single line. Here's a breakdown of the arguments:\n",
    "\n",
    "`-I` uses GiST to add an index on the new table's geometry column.\n",
    "\n",
    "`-s` lets you specify an SRID for the geometric data.\n",
    "\n",
    "`-W` lets you specify encoding. (Recall that we used `Latin1` for census shapefiles.)\n",
    "\n",
    "`shapefile_name` is the name (including the full path) of the file ending with the *.shp* extension.\n",
    "\n",
    "`table_name` is the name fo the table the shapefile is imported to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Following these arguments, you place a pipe symbol (`|`) to direct the output of `shp2pgsql` to `psql`, which has the arguments for naming the database & user. For example, to load the *tl_2019_us_county.shp* shapefile into a `us_counties_2019_shp` table in the `analysis` database, you can run the following command. Note that although this command wraps onto two lines here, it should be entered as one line in the command line (Remember to change your working directory to the folder holding the shapefile & to make sure there isn't any table named `us_counties_2019_shp` already. You can drop the table & run the below code again.):\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "shp2pgsql -I -s 4269 -W LATIN1 tl_2019_us_county.shp us_counties_2019_shp | psql -d analysis -U postgres\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The server should respond with a number of SQL `INSERT` statements before creating the index & returning you to the command line. It might take some time to construct the entire set of arguments the first time around, but after you've done one, subsequent imports should take less time. You can simply substitute file & table names into the syntax you already wrote.\n",
