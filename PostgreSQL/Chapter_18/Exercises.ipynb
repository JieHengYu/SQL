    "To reinforce the techniques in this chapter, choose an example from an earlier lesson & try working thgouh it using only the command line. Lesson 15, \"Analysing Spatial Data with PostGIS\", is a good choice because it gives us the opportunitiy to work with `psql` & the shapefile loader `shp2pgsql`. That said, you are encoursaged to choose any example that you think you would benefit from reviewing."
