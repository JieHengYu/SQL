    "1. Dig deeper into the nuances of Waikiki's high temperatures. Limit the `temps_collapsed` table to the Waikiki maximum daily temperature observations. Then use the `WHEN` clauses in the `CASE` statement to reclassify the temperatures into seven groups that would result in the following text output:\n",
