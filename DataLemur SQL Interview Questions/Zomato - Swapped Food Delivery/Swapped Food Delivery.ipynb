    "# Swapped Food Delivery\n",
    "\n",
    "Zomato is a leading online food delivery service that connects users with various restaurants & cuisines, allowing them to browse menus, place orders, & get meals delivered to their doorsteps. \n",
    "\n",
    "Recently, Zomato encountered an issue with their delivery system. Due to an error in the delivery driver instructions, each item's order was swapped with the item in the subsequent row. As a data analyst, you're asked to correct this swapping error & return the proper pairing of order ID & item.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the last item as an odd order ID, it should remain as the last item in the corrected data. For example, if the last item is Order ID 7 Tandoori Chicken, then it hsould remain as Order ID 7 in the corrected data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the results, return the correct pairs of order IDs & items.\n",
