    "Assume you're given a table containing information about Wayfair user transactions for different products. Write a query to calculate the year-over-year growth rate for the total spent of each product, grouping the results by product ID.\n",

    "The output should include the year in ascending order, product ID, current year's spend, previous year's spend & year-on-year growth percentage, rounded to 2 decimal places.\n",
