    "Assume you're given tables with information on Snapchat users, including their ages & time spent sending & opening snaps.\n",

    "Write a query to obtain a breakdown of the time spent sending vs opening snaps as a percentage of total time spent on these activities grouped by age group. Round the percentage to 2 decimal places in the output.\n",

    "Notes:\n",

    "* Calculate the following percentages:\n",
    "   * time spent sending / (time spent sending + time spent opening)\n",
    "   * time spent opening / (time spent sending + time spent opening)\n",
    "* To avoid integer division in percentages, multiply by 100.0 & not 100.\n",
