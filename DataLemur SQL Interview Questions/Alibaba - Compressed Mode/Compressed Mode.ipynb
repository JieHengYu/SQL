    "You're given a table containing the item count for each order on Alibaba, along with the frequency of orders that have the same item count. Write a query to retrieve the mode of the order occurrences. Additionally, if there are multiple item counts with the same mode, the results should be sorted in ascending order.\n",

    "* `item_count`: Represents the number of items sold in each order.\n",
    "* `order_occurrences`: Represents the frequency of orders with the corresponding number of items sold per order.\n",
    "* For example, if there are 800 orders with 3 items sold in each order, the record would have an `item_count` of `3` & an `order_occurrences` of 800.\n",
