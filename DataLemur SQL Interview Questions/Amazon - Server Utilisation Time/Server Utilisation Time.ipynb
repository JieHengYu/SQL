    "# Server Utilisation Time\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon Web Services (AWS) is powered by fleets of servers. Senior management has requested data-driven solutions to optimise their server usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a query that calculates the total time that the fleet of servers was running. The output should be in units of full days.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each server might start & stop several times.\n",
    "* The total time in which the server fleet is running can be calculated as the sum of each server's uptime.\n",
