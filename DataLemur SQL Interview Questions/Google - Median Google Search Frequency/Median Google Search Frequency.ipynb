    "# Median Google Search Frequency\n",
    "\n",
    "Google's marketing team is making a Superbowl commercial & needs a simple statistic to put to their TV ad: the median number of searches a person made last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, at Google scale, querying the 2 trillion searches is too costly. Luckily, you have access to the summary table which tells you the number of searches made last year & how many Google user's fall into that bucket.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a query to report the median of searches made by a user. Round the median to one decimal point.\n",
