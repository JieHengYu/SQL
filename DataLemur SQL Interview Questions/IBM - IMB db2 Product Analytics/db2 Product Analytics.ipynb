    "IBM is analysing how their employees are utilising the Db2 database by tracking the SQL queries executed by their employees. The objective is to generate data to populate a hitogram that shows the number of unique queries run by employees during the third quarter of 2023 (July to September). Additionally, it should count the number of employees who did not run queries during this period.\n",

    "Display the number of unique queries as histogram categories, along with the count of employees who executed that number of unique queries.\n",
