    "# Maximise Prime Item Inventory\n",
    "\n",
    "Amazon wants to maximise the storage capacity of its 500,000 square-foot warehouse by prioritising a specific batch of prime items. The specific prime product batch detailed in the `inventory` table must be maintained.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, if the prime product batch specified in the `item_category` column included 1 laptop & 1 side table, that would be the base bach. We could not add another laptop without also adding a side table; they come all together as a batch set.\n",
    "\n",
    "After prioritising the maximum number of prime batches, any remaining square footage will be utilised to stock non-prime batches, which also come in batch sets & cannot be separated into individual items.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a query to find the maximum number of prime & non-prime batches that can be stored in the 500,000 square feet warehouse based on the following criteria:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Prioritise stocking prime batches\n",
    "* After accommodating prime items, allocate any remaining space to non-prime batches\n",
    "\n",
    "Output the `item_type` with `prime_eligible` first followed by `not_prime`, along with the maximum number of batches that can be stocked.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Again, products must be stocked in batches, so we want to find the largest available quantity of prime batches, & then the largest available quantity of non-rime batches\n",
    "* Non-prime items must always be available in stock to meet customer demand, so the non-prime item count should never be zero.\n",
    "* Item count should be whole numbers (integers).\n",
    "\n",

    "I am using the `inventory` table:\n",

    "Ok, so if I'm understanding correctly, if I have 1 of each prime item in the `inventory` table, that is considered 1 prime batch... Same for non-prime items -- if I have 1 of each non-prime item, that is considered 1 non-prime batch... But then each single batch will have the an item count. We then just prioritise the prime batch over the non-prime batch to maximise 500,000 square feet. \n",
