    "# Unfinished Parts\n",
    "\n",
    "Tesla is investigating production bottlenecks & they need your help to extract the relevant data. Write a query to determine which parts have begun the assembly process but aren't finished yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `parts_assembly` table contains all parts currently in production, each at varying stages of the assembly process\n",
    "* An unfinished part is one that lacks a `finish_date`.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer\n",
    "\n",
    "This is what the `parts_assembly` table looks like:\n",

    "```\n",
    "CREATE TABLE parts_assembly (\n",
    "\tpart varchar(10),\n",
    "\tfinish_date timestamp,\n",

    "\n",
    "Based on the assumption that an unfinished part is one that lacks a `finish_date` column value, all we have to do is find the part that has a missing `finish_date` column.\n",

    "```\n",
