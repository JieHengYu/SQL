    "# Top Three Salaries\n",
    "\n",
    "As part of an ongoing analysis of salary distribution within the company, your manager has requested a report identifying high earners in each department. A 'high earner' within a department is defined as an employee with a salary ranking among the top three salaries within that department.\n",
    "\n",
    "You're tasked with identifying these high earners across all departments. Write a query to display the employee's name along with their department name & salary. In case of duplicates sort the results of department name in ascending order, then by salary in descending order. If multiple employees have the same salary, then order them alphabetically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Utilise the appropriate ranking window function to handle duplicate salaries effectively.\n",

    "Ok, good thing I used the `rank()` function. There is a two-way tie for 2nd highest paid employee in department 1, & the `rank()` function appropriately continues with the rank 4 instead of 3 (`dense_rank()` would have outputted 3 for the 4th highest paid employee), allowing us to use a simple number filter to find the top 3 salaries in each department. \n",
